                <p>There are many different things that come to mind when we think about Monkeys. They are often seen as being cute and highly intelligent animals. They are known for being good care givers to the young and even having some humanistic movements.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are 264 known species of Monkeys in the world. They are often included with Apes but they are very different. The main difference is that the Apes don’t have a tail.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are two categories – the New World and the Old World Monkeys. It is believed that they split through evolution approximately 40 million years ago.<br>
